## Fauntage

A PhantomJS based script that scrapes a page of x5 scaled Font Awesome icons into transparent `png` files.  If you need to do this then this will do it.  But ask yourself - Do you need this?  Really?  Why?  I never asked myself that question.  But turns out I did anyway.  For a thing.  Yeah thas right Ihad a thing that needed this.  What of it?  Use it or don't.  No biggie.

### Usage

If you've got this far and want to use it and you've asked yourself why and gotten a "Becasue %REASONS%" themn lets go.

    phantomjs capture.js
    
You need phantomjs installed.  Images go in the, wait for it, `images` folder.  Mind blown.
